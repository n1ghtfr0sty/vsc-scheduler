## Commits

### f04eede — Seed: add Spring '26 mock schedule (32 games, March–April 2026)
- **Files:** `src/seed.js`
- Refactored opponent insertion to capture IDs by name instead of hardcoded integers
- Added Spring '26 season (2026-03-01 to 2026-04-30)
- Added 32 games across 8 Saturdays (Mar 7 – Apr 25), 4 games per day
- Each team plays 4 games, balanced 2 home / 2 away
- Coaches staggered within each game day to prevent conflicts (verified by SQL query)

### d3f80b8 — Fix: add missing nextWeek() method to Calendar
- **Files:** `public/js/calendar.js`
- Week-view forward button called `calendar.nextWeek()` which didn't exist
- `previousWeek()` existed but its counterpart was never defined
- `nextMonth()` had dead week-view code that was never reached

### b70524b — Teams detail: edit button, clickable player/family links; add detail pages
- **Files:** `src/routes/players.js`, `src/routes/families.js`, `public/js/api.js`, `public/js/app.js`, `public/css/style.css`
- Team detail page: added Edit button (permission-gated), Back button
- Player names on team detail now link to `/players/:id`
- Family names on team detail now link to `/families/:id` (if user can view families)
- New `renderPlayerDetail()` page: player info, family link, team links, Edit button
- New `renderFamilyDetail()` page: contact info, players table with links
- Backend: `GET /api/players/:id` and `GET /api/families/:id` endpoints
- Frontend: `API.players.getOne()` and `API.families.getOne()` methods
- Routes: `/players/:id` and `/families/:id` registered
- CSS: `.link` class for styled anchor tags
- Note: `/families/:id` placed after `/my` route to avoid Express param conflict
